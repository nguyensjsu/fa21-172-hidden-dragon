**Accomplishments**

- Started working on the front end portal implementing the overall framework in which the user will interact with. I went with a simple user interface involving login, register, and checkout in the navigation bar in which when clicked will open the form that the controller will read the values from. This insures simplicity and allows the user to not be confused upon using the user interface. 

**Challenges**

- None
