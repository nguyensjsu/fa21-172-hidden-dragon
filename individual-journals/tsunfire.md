## Week 2

**Snapshot**

**Accomplishments**

- **[1.0.2]** I added user schema to the database and seeded initial data. I setup API routes in the UserController for login and register functionality, which required querying. I also setup a Postman collection, so that group members could the test the API endpoints during their implementation. https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa21-172-hidden-dragon/commit/d7d4b12873d2119a3f8cc8770f73f2ca2e549ac4
- **[1.0.1]** I added MySQL connection to Spring application through CRUDRepository and Spring JPA. Add item schema and setup purchase API endpoint. https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa21-172-hidden-dragon/commit/4b03738ef855526311cdcaafe2ae9e977199afb7

**Challenges**

- I couldn't for the longest time figure out how to use my local instance of MySQL on computer. I tried all available ways of resetting the password (uninstalling and modifying user profiles). Whenever I would use SQL in this class in the past, I hadn't gotten it to work because the Spring application would connect to the local instance on port 3306 rather than the docker image. For some reason, I never noticed that there was a conflict and tried another port or killed the local instance.
